# BaccartEngine.net

The baccarat engine project is meant as a library in order to ease the calculation of baccarat game results, roadmaps generated from a collection of games, and other various statistics connected to games of baccarat. The module is also intended to be expandable and pluggable to offer simple calculation of new side bets.

It is a dot net port of https://github.com/jconradi/baccarat-engine

Since I couldn't find any C# code for Baccarat RoadMap, I looked up github and found the above mentioned link for Javascript.

I am contributing this code in case someone need to write Baccarat Roadmap in C#. 

My main purpose is to use this code to write a 全局分析 Baccarat software taught by my teacher 赌行侠

Hope you enjoy it. It is not ready yet as I am still working on it.

The UI I will be using for the frontend will be DevExpress WPF or Winforms components.
