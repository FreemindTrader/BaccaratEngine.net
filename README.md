# BaccartEngine.net

The baccarat engine project is meant as a library in order to ease the calculation of baccarat game results, roadmaps generated from a collection of games, and other various statistics connected to games of baccarat. The module is also intended to be expandable and pluggable to offer simple calculation of new side bets.

It is a dot net port of https://github.com/jconradi/baccarat-engine

Since I couldn't find any C# code for Baccarat RoadMap, I looked up github and found the above mentioned link for Javascript.

I am contributing this code in case someone need to write Baccarat Roadmap in C#. 

My main purpose is to use this code to write a 全局分析 Baccarat software taught by my teacher 赌行侠. This master is amazing. I have attended his class for over half a year now. In his live lessons, he will demo play 3 shoes of baccarat with even bet of 500 per hand. He never lose in any shoe of games and average like 10000+ of winning per shoe. Holy....
That's the whole reason I am writing this software to automate what he did.

I am only releasing the engine and the demo UI to help out other C# engineers. You can say I am old fashion. I just simply don't like NOT so serious programming language ( Javascript to me is too not sophiscated. I love high performance programming langauge guess from my coding high frequent trading software experience )

If anyone is interested in a very HIGH probabilty of winning baccarat. Free feel to contact me.

The UI I am using for the frontend will be DevExpress XAF (planning). The demo is using DevExpress Winforms Controls.
